# Video2Hap ðŸŽ¬  Batch Convert Videos to HAP Format

[ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

Video2Hap ðŸŽ¬ is a batch video conversion tool for HAP encoding, supporting Windows and macOS.

This is a personal tool I use, and I hope it helps you as well.

## Features
Video2Hap utilizes Python to call FFmpeg for video format conversion, eliminating the need for complex graphical software or tedious settings.

Simply provide a folder path containing video files, and Video2Hap will automatically detect and convert them into HAP format. Videos containing alpha information will be automatically detected and converted into HAP_Alpha encoding.

## Why HAP?
HAP is a codec specifically designed for high-performance real-time video playback, commonly used in new media art, immersive projection, stage performances, VJing, interactive installations, and more.

Compared to H.264, HAP offers the following advantages:

âœ… **GPU decoding** for smoother playback and reduced CPU load  
âœ… **Supports Alpha channel**, making it suitable for videos with transparent backgrounds  
âœ… **Lossless frame compression** to maintain high-quality visuals  
âœ… **Low latency**, ideal for real-time playback  

I primarily use HAP encoding in Max/MSP to handle multiple video files simultaneously. HAP significantly improves playback performance, ensuring smoother and more stable multi-video playback. Moreover, many mainstream video tools (such as TouchDesigner, Resolume, Unreal Engine, Notch, MadMapper, etc.) offer excellent support for HAP, making it an ideal choice for digital art, new media, and real-time visuals.

## Prerequisites
